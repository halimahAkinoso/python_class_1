# #### **A. Conditional Statements**

# age = 20
# if age >= 18:
#     print("You are eligible to vote")



# #     2. `if-else` Statement

# # - Provides two alternative paths.
# wallet = 400
# price = 500

# if wallet >= price:
#     print("Purchase successful")
# else:
#     print("Insufficient balance")


#     # 3. `if-elif-else` Statement
# # - Used for multiple conditions.
# score = 85
# if score >= 70:
#     print("Grade A")
# elif score >= 50:
#     print("Grade B")
# else:
#     print("Grade C")



# #     4. Nested if
# # - Placing an `if` inside another `if`.

# age = 19
# citizen = True

# if age >= 18:
#     if citizen:
#         print("You can vote")
#     else:
#         print("You must be a citizen to vote")
# else:
#     print("Too young to vote")


# #     **1. `for` loop**
# # - This is used for iterating over a sequence (strings, list, tuple, dictionary)
# # Iterates through each element in a LIST.

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(f"I like {fruit}")


# ## Some usecases
# # Iterating through shopping lists.

# # Checking availability of products.

# # Displaying student names, etc.


# # Iterates through each element in a TUPLE.This Works like lists, but remember that tuples are immutable.

# coordinates = (0.34654, -0.48585, 0.57477)
# for number in coordinates:
#     print(f"Point: {number}")

# ## Some usecases
# # Storing fixed sensor readings.
# # Displaying fixed seating positions, etc.



# # Iterates through each element in a DICTIONARY. Remember that
#  dictionaries have key-value pairs.


# student = {"name": "Tunde", "age": 16, "grade": "A"}
# for key, value in student.items():
#     print(f"{key}: {value}")

# ## Some usecases

# # Reading database records.

# # Showing user profile details.

# # Checking configuration settings, etc.


# # Iterates through each element in a STRING. Remember that strings are sequences of characters.

# word = "PYTHON"
# for char in word:
#     print(char)

# ## Some usecases

# # Counting vowels/consonants.

# # Password validation (checking digits/special chars).

# # Text analysis, etc.
# # -----------------------------------------------------------

# # \**2. `While` loop**

# # - A while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code **as long as a given condition is true.**
# # Unlike the for loop (which iterates over sequences like lists, tuples, etc.), the while loop is condition-based.

# # ```
# # while condition:
# #     # code block
# # ```

# # - The condition must evaluate to `True` for the loop to continue running.

# # - When the condition becomes `False`, the loop stops.
# #-------------------------------------------------
# # Using while loop

# ## Documenting my thoughts##
# # Let the loop start with count = 1
# # Let it keep printing until count is greater than 5
# # Let the loop terminate when the condition is no longer true

## My code
# count = 2
# while count <= 5:
#     print("Number:", count)
#     count += 1



# # Incrementing with `while`

# num = 1
# while num <= 10:
#     print(num, end=" ")
#     num += 1



# # Decrementing with `while`

# timer = 10
# while timer > 0:
#     print("Countdown:", timer)
#     timer -= 1




#     # While with User Input
# ## Keep asking until the user enters a correct password.

# password = ""
# while password != "python123":
#     password = input("Enter the password: ")

# print("Access Granted!")



# # **Understanding `while True`**

# # # - The while True: loop is an infinite loop — it keeps running forever until you explicitly stop it with a break statement or by exiting the program.

# # # - It is commonly used when:

# # # - You don’t know in advance how many times you want the loop to run.

# # # - You want to keep asking the user for input until a valid condition is met.

# # # - You are building continuous programs like menus, login systems, or simulations.


# # # ```
# # # while True:
# # #     # Code block
# # #     # Must include a break statement to stop

# # # ```


# # Keep asking the user for a name until they type "exit".

# while True:
#     name = input("Enter your name (type 'exit' to quit): ")
#     if name.lower() == "exit":
#         print("Goodbye!")
#         break
#     print(f"Hello, {name}")

# # ---> I used `break` here. If you dont know what it is or what it is doing, its OK. I will explain it next...

# ## Useful in chat-like applications, forms, or data entry programs where users may input multiple times until they decide to stop.



# #### **Loop Control Statements (`break`, `continue` and `pass`)**
# # - These keywords help us control the behavior of loops (for and while). Instead of loops always running all iterations, we can skip steps, stop early, or do nothing intentionally.
# # **1. break**
# # - Stops loop immediately. It is used if a condition is met and there’s no need to continue looping.
# for num in range(1, 10):
#     if num == 5:
#         break
#     print(num)

# #The loop stops completely when num == 5.

# # Stop searching when an item is found.

# # Exit when user input matches a condition.

# # Prevent unnecessary iterations.

# # **2. Continue**
# # - Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one. It is used if you want to ignore some values but keep the loop running.
# for num in range(1, 6):
#     if num == 2:
#         continue
#     print(num)

# # 3 is skipped, but the loop continues.

# ## Some usecases

# #Skip invalid data.

# #Ignore unwanted characters (like spaces in a string).

# #Continue running but avoid certain cases, etc.


# # **3. Pass**
# # - Does nothing. A placeholder to avoid errors. It is used If you haven’t written the code yet but want to keep the structure.

for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        pass   # do nothing for now
    else:
        print(num)

# # At num == 3, Python executes pass (nothing happens).

# ## Some usecases

# # Writing code structure (to fill in later).

# # Placeholders in class/method definitions.

# # Temporarily disable parts of code.

# # Try and think through this...

# while True:
#     print("\nMenu:")
#     print("1. Say Hello")
#     print("2. Say Goodbye")
#     print("3. Exit")
    
#     choice = input("Choose an option: ")
    
#     if choice == "1":
#         print("Hello")
#     elif choice == "2":
#         print("Goodbye")
#     elif choice == "3":
#         print("Exiting program...")
#         break
#     else:
#         print("Invalid choice. Try again.")



#         # Try and use while True for validation

# while True:
#     age = input("Enter your age: ")
#     if age.isdigit():
#         print(f"Your age is {age}")
#         break
#     else:
#         print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

34

#         # LEets make a guess

# secret = "python"

# while True:
#     guess = input("Guess the secret word: ")
#     if guess.lower() == secret:
#         print("Correct! You guessed the word.")
#         break
#     else:
#         print("Wrong! Try again.")




# # Do you remember this?

balance = 1000  

while True:
    print("\nATM Menu:")
    print("1. Check Balance")
    print("2. Withdraw")
    print("3. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter choice: ")

    if choice == "1":
        print(f"Your balance is: {balance}")
    elif choice == "2":
        amount = int(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
        if amount <= balance:
            balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrawal successful. New balance: {balance}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
    elif choice == "3":
        print("Thank you for using our ATM. Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid option. Try again.")
